I. Introduction:

Abundance (ABC)

Abundance is a concept of spreading the wealth of a coin (or Abundance) and allowing its holders to make residual income off of the coin through the PoS algorithm.  We call this an INCOME coin. We’ll make no further promises other than we’re going to do or best as a team and that this coin direct response of empty promises and disappearing development teams...
  
The Abundance (ABC)  development team welcomes the challenge of earning your trust.

II. Highlights and Advantages of this Coin:
Highlights

Innovations - Sure we’re a shitcoin as far as the technology is concerned, but we've come up with 2 things that differentiates ABC from other coins...

In Distribution: PoE - "Proof of Effort" This one involves no mining, but human efforts.  It's not a true giveaway coin like CommunityCoin or Coin2, as we require effort/promotion/social media tasks in order to help create momentum and community for Abundance.

Income/PoS - Abundance is so aggressive in its staking/interest, that we're calling it an income coin.  The act of holding this coin creates income to the tune of 20% monthly interest or over 240% annual interest in the 1st month and gradually tapers off over time...  

We want to reward people for holding Abundance and think that more coins will start copying this income approach...

ABC has 2 distinct PoE phases of distributing our coins to those that earn them....

PoW - Yes there is mining - concentration of 355,000 Coins over 10 Days.

How do I attain Abundance?  We are very inclusionary...
